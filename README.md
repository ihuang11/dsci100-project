<h1> Data Summary Description <h1></h1>

This project will analyze two datasets,  `player.csv` and `sessions.csv` to answer two questions about the likelihood of subscription in a data science project about a Minecraft server. It explores how player characteristics and behaviour relate to newsletter subscription decisions in an online gaming context. The core research question is: 

Does newsletter subscription status differ significantly across experience levels (Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, Pro) when controlling for total playtime and average session duration?

To answer this, the project uses a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification model, chosen for its suitability with binary classification tasks and its flexibility with non-linear relationships.

In my project proposal, I summarize the two datasets, pose my question, do minimal wrangling to explore the data, and create visualizations to better interpret the numbers.
